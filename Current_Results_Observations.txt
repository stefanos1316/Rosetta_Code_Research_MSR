==================

Concurrent-Computing:  	Python offerend around 7 different implementations, however, the impementation 
			that uses a thread pool provides the highest degree of run-time performance.
			
			JS's web workers uses large amount of main memory while interating the current 
			task for a million of times. 
			As a result, after a certain period of time, the system runs out of memory which 
			lead to system crash.
