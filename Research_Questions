* **RQ2:** What are the energy conusmption implications against the tasks' run-time performance?

* **RQ3:** What are the energy conusmption implications against the tasks' memory usage?

* **RQ4:** Which of the programming langauges features (e.g., garbage collector, dynamic binding, 
lazy evaluation, reflaction, and so on) contributes to extensive energy usage?

* **RQ5:** For which tasks' category (e.g., arithmetic, concurrency, compression, file-handling) 
the selected programming languages offers the most gains in terms of energy efficiency?
