# Research Questions

1) Energy Efficiency of Languages for tasks 
2) Energy Efficiency against Performance (execution time)
3) Energy Efficiency against Performance (memory)
4) Energy Efficiency of Language features (garbage collectior, 
   dynamic binding, lazy evaluation, pattern matching, 
   dynamic/static/strong/weak typing, reflaction, etc.)
5) Energy Efficiency of Task's type (recursive, computational-intensive, and so on)
