# Research Questions

RQ1: Which programming languages offer the highest energy efficiency among the selected tasks?

RQ2: What is the relationship between tasks' implementations energy usage and run-time performance?
     or 
     Which programming languages are more energy and run-time performance efficient?

RQ3: What is the relationship between tasks' implementations energy usage and memory usage?
	(We should make use of the maximum resident set size since it includes the memory 
	 footprint of the runtime environment and has the real RAM usage, not swapped 
         memory)
     or 
     Which programming languages make better energy and memory usage?

     Note: How to related CPU and MEM usage with a coarse-grained result on energy consumption?
	Make a small test to identify at each % of CPU usage what is the total energy usage and 
	we can asume the remaining is for the memory usage?


RQ4: Which of the programming languages features (e.g., garbage collector, dynamic binding, 
lazy evaluation, reflaction, and so on) contribute in extensive energy usage?

RQ5: For which tasks' category the selected programming languages offer the most gains in 
terms of energy efficiency?
