# Research Questions

RQ1: 	Which programming languages offer the highest energy efficiency among the selected tasks?
      	Changed  to:
	What is the energy efficiency of programming languages in relation to specific task? (We can use EDP--Energy Delay Product)	

RQ2: What is the relationship between tasks' implementations energy usage and run-time performance?
     Change to:
     Which programming languages are more energy and run-time performance efficient? (We can use the EDP)

RQ3: What is the relationship between tasks' implementations energy usage and memory usage?
	(We should make use of the maximum resident set size since it includes the memory 
	 footprint of the runtime environment and has the real RAM usage, not swapped 
         memory)
     Changed to:
     Which programming languages make better energy and memory usage? (We may consider using the EMP--Energy Memory Product)


RQ4: Which of the programming languages features (e.g., garbage collector, dynamic binding, 
lazy evaluation, reflaction, and so on) contribute in extensive energy usage?

	In regard to this, we expect the outcome from the research questions above.


We might see this thought the results
