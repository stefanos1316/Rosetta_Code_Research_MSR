# Function composition

Explanation in this [link](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Function_composition)


**Task**

Create a function, compose,   whose two arguments   f   and   g,   are both functions with one argument.

The result of compose is to be a function of one argument, (lets call the argument   x),   which works like applying function   f   to the result of applying function   g   to   x.

	compose(f, g) (x) = f(g(x))
