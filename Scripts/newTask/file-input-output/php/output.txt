The Republic By Plato
=====================

PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE.
Socrates, who is the narrator.
Glaucon.
Adeimantus.
Polemarchus.
Cephalus.
Thrasymachus.
Cleitophon.
And others who are mute auditors.
The scene is laid in the house of Cephalus at the Piraeus; and the whole dialogue
is narrated by Socrates the day after it actually took place to Timaeus,
Hermocrates, Critias, and a nameless person, who are introduced in the Timaeus.
I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I
might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian Artemis.); and
also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival,
which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants;
but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had
finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the
city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight
of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant
to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind,
and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.
I turned round, and asked him where his master was.
There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.
Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus appeared,
and with him Adeimantus, Glauconâ€™s brother, Niceratus the son of Nicias, and
several others who had been at the procession.
Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your companion are
already on your way to the city.
You are not far wrong, I said.
But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?
Of course.
And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain where
you are.
May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let us go?
But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.
Certainly not, replied Glaucon.
Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.
Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour
of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches and pass
them one to another during the race?
Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated at night,
which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after supper and see this
festival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we will have a good talk.
Stay then, and do not be p
