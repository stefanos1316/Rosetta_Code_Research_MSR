# Concurrent computing

Explanation in this [link](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)


**Task**

Using either native language concurrency syntax or freely available libraries, write a program to display the strings "Enjoy" "Rosetta" "Code", one string per line, in random order.

Concurrency syntax must use threads, tasks, co-routines, or whatever concurrency is called in your language.
