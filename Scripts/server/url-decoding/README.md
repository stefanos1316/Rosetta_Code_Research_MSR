# URL decoding

Explanation in this [link](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/URL_decoding)


**Task**

This task   (the reverse of   URL encoding   and distinct from   URL parser)   is to provide a function or mechanism to convert an URL-encoded string into its original unencoded form.


Test cases
  The encoded string   "http%3A%2F%2Ffoo%20bar%2F"   should be reverted to the unencoded form   "http://foo bar/".
  The encoded string   "google.com/search?q=%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1"   should revert to the unencoded form   "google.com/search?q=`Abdu'l-Bah√°".
