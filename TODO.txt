Tasks TODO
==========

+Test the Laptops and RPi's Wilcox significance in order to decide where to test.
+Create EDP graphs for programming languages and tasks.
+Add functional programming languages such as: F# and Haskell.
+Start writing some parts of the paper 


Rosetta Code Data-Set
=====================
Here we will describe how we extracted the data, filter them and changes we did 
on the data-set.
Plus contribution.


Tasks selection
===============
Based on the collected programming languages, we developed a script 
that is used to idetify which of the 866 tasks have more implementations for the 
PL of our selection.
We make the assumption that these tasks as the most used and easy to find online 
since they are implemented in the most programming languages.
Therefore, from the extracted data-set, we selected the tasks that are develoepd in 
at least half of the selected programming languages.


Programming Languages selection
===============================
The selection was made based on Tiobe, moreover, since no pure functional 
programming langauges are found in top 20, we decided to add F# and Haskell 
in our data-set.


Energy Delay Product
====================
Give discussion based on the current formual and what we are going to use to 
in our results.
For our experiment we are going to use the function as follows:

	EDP = Energy * Time^w 		where w=1,2, and 3

Graphs
======
We expect to have 2 graphs with normalized results. 
The programming language with the lowest EDP is going to be the 
normalized results while all the others are going to resutls in 
much higher results.
Also, do the same for the tasks to identify which task has less 
energy consumption.


Stereo has a lot of repos.
ask vasiliki of inderectly get commits.
