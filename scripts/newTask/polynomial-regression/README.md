# Polynomial regression

Explanation in this [link](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)


**Task**

Find an approximating polynomial of known degree for a given data.

Example: For input data:

		x = {0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,   7,   8,   9,   10};
		y = {1,  6,  17, 34, 57, 86, 121, 162, 209, 262, 321};

The approximating polynomial is:

		3 x2 + 2 x + 1

Here, the polynomial's coefficients are (3, 2, 1)
